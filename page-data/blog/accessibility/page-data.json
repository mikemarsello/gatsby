While it does not explicitly address colleges and universities, they would be affected if they receive any funding from the federal or state government.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.essentialaccessibility.com/blog/web-content-accessibility-guidelines-wcag/\">The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> are a set of universally accepted technical requirements produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that explains how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Version 2.0 was published on December 2008 and is the most up-to-date set of requirements for web accessibility.</p>\n<p>I work at the University of Texas whose accessibility policies are outlined <a href=\"https://cio.utexas.edu/policies/web-accessibility\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Images</h3>\n<p>The easiest thing to check for is that images always have alt text. Alt text should be short and descriptive. An example of good alt text would be \"boy riding a yellow bicycle\". An example of poor alt text would be \"image\" or \"picture\".</p>\n<h3>Colors</h3>\n<p>We must insure that text is legible for sight-impaired users. The legibility of text is determined by a combination of its font-size, font-weight and color/background-color. There are some online tools available to test whether text has acceptable contrast. I like <a href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a> because it tells whether contrast meets WCAG AA and AAA standards.</p>\n<h3>Accessibility Checkers</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/accessibility-testing-tools/\">CSS-Tricks Overview</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core\">AXE</a> is a Chrome plugin brought to us by Deque who also make WorldSpace, a common automated accessibility testing tool. AXE is great for testing local sites that don't have a public URL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wave.webaim.org/\">WAVE</a> is great for checking sites that have a public URL to test. It gives results similar to AXE.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/\">Lighthouse</a> is a product created by Google that differs from other accessibiity checkers in that it can be run from the command line. This means it can be automated as part of existing workflows.</p>\n<h3>ARIA attributes</h3>\n<p>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make Web content and Web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>\n<h3>Forms</h3>\n<p>A popular web design trend is to use placeholder text in lieu of a label on form elements. This should be strongly discouraged and a form label should be used. In addition, ARIA attributes should be used to reinforce the relationship between a form element and its corresponding label.</p>\n<h3>Gotchas</h3>\n<p>Never set the outline to none in CSS.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"css\">\n      <pre class=\"language-css\"><code class=\"language-css\"><span class=\"token property\">outline</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> none<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Always provide a \"skip to content\" link\nAlways set the lang attribute in your site metadata as screenreaders will use this.</p>\n<p>Don't overdo it with ARIA attributes. Attributes related to menus such as \"role=menu\" and \"role=menuitem\" should NOT be used on main navigation menus. These attributes should only be used on applications with a menu of actions whereas the navigation on a website is just an organized list of links.</p>\n<h3>Important Links</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://davatron5000.github.io/a11y-nutrition-cards/\">https://davatron5000.github.io/a11y-nutrition-cards/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://a11yproject.com/checklist\">https://a11yproject.com/checklist</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/\">https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://accessible-colors.com/\">http://accessible-colors.com/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://a11yproject.com/patterns\">https://a11yproject.com/patterns</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2018-8-30","path":"/blog/accessibility","title":"accessibility","author":"Mike Marsello","template":"blog","desc":"accessibility"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
